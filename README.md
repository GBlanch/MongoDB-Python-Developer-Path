# MongoDB-Python-Developer-Path

This learning path contains a series of courses on the core MongoDB skills. In this path, I learnt the basics of building modern applications with Python, using MongoDB as a database.

1. Start Here - Intro to MongoDB:
   
   This unit gives an overview of MongoDB fundamentals, from the document model to CRUD operations to indexing, that you will learn during the Introduction to MongoDB course.
   

3. Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas:
   
   Learn about MongoDB Atlas, the fully-managed multi-cloud developer data platform, its latest features, and how to deploy clusters.

4. MongoDB and the **Document Model**:
   
   Want to learn more about MongoDB and the document model? In this unit, you’ll learn how to manage MongoDB databases, collections, and documents.

5. MongoDB **Data Modeling**:
   
   Learn the basics of data modeling, the process of defining how data is stored and the relationships among different entities in your data, in MongoDB.

6. Connecting to a MongoDB Database:
   
   Learn how to connect to MongoDB databases by using connection strings. Connection strings allow you to connect your cluster with the mongo shell, with Compass (our GUI that enables querying, optimizing and analyzing MongoDB data), and to an application.

7. Connecting to MongoDB in Python:
   
   Learn about the Python driver for MongoDB and how to use it to connect to your Python applications.

8. MongoDB CRUD Operations: **Insert** and **Find** Documents:
   
   Learn how to create, find, and query MongoDB documents in the mongo shell.

9. MongoDB CRUD Operations: **Replace** and **Delete** Documents:

    Learn how to replace and delete documents in the mongo shell.

10. MongoDB CRUD Operations: **Modifying** Query Results:
   
   Learn how to sort and limit query results and how to count documents in MongoDB.

11. MongoDB CRUD Operations in Python:

    Learn how to perform basic CRUD operations with the MongoDB Python driver.

12. MongoDB **Aggregation** in Python I:
   
    Learn how to create aggregation pipelines with Python.
   
13. MongoDB **Aggregation** in Python II:
   
    Learn how to create aggregation pipelines that enable you to analyze and summarize data by stringing together stages that filter, sort, group, and/or transform data.

14. MongoDB **Indexes**:
   
    Learn how to improve MongoDB performance by learning how to create single, compound, and multikey indexes as well as how to delete indexes.

15. MongoDB **Atlas Search**:
   
    Learn about MongoDB Atlas Search, a full text search feature that combines three systems - database, search engine, and sync mechanisms.

16. MongoDB **Transactions**:

    Learn about ACID transactions in MongoDB and how they guarantee certain database operations happen together or not at all to ensure data integrity within the database.

17. MongoDB **Compass**:
   
    Learn how to create aggregation pipelines with Python.

18. **PyMongoArrow**:
   
    Learn how to enhance your MongoDB database’s data analytics capability using PyMongoArrow, an extension to the PyMongo library.

19. MongoDB **VS Code Extension**:
   
    Learn how to use the MongoDB VS Code extension to create, manage, and query MongoDB databases.
